# Project-4
This is my fourth project for the Team Treehouse Tech Degree. I really enjoyed working on my object-oriented programming skills with is project. My initial idea was to make it a Predator themed game, with each background being a scene from the movie and the phrases being quotes from the movie. I was unsure about the copyright issues when submitting the project so I ended up using free domain images I found online. That is why there is a jungle theme and the text color is similar to the Predator movie text color.
Later on, I would like to improve on the background and give the game a back story to make it more fun to play. I will continue to look for free domain content. 

In my CSS file I changed the background image for for .start, .win, .lose and .body. I also modified the text color for header, h1 and h2 elements. In the handleInteraction method I also added a green border and back ground for correct letters guessed and a red border for incorrect letters guessed.

Thank you for taking a look and I hope you enjoyed playing it!
